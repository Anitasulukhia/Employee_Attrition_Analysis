## Project Contributions

### 

We would like to clarify that, although we worked on separate notebooks—Anastasia focused on data_analysis_and_eda and Guga focused on machine learning—we both actively contributed to each other's tasks. We collaborated closely on deciding which features to engineer, which features to drop, the choice of models, approaches to handle class imbalance, and all other key decisions throughout the project. This collaborative effort ensured consistency and alignment across the entire workflow.

### Anastasia
- Implemented the **data_analysis_and_cleaning** notebook
- Performed data analysis and visualizations
- Prepared data for machine learning models
- Defined the general project structure
- Created the PowerPoint presentation and readme

### Guga
- Implemented machine learning models
- Trained and evaluated **two different models** using multiple approaches
- Compared model performance
- Wrote a report summarizing insights and results
